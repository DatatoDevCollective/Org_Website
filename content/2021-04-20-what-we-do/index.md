We build open source tools so that for everyone trying to solve the biggest challenges around the world don't have to reinvent the wheel.

- We are crowdfunded.
- We believe in the power of open source to drive innovation and accelerate social tech development - create open source tools.
- We work with humanitarian, civic and environmental organisations.
- We build a community of data scientists and developer contributors.
